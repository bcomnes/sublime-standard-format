# TODO

- toggle either standard or semistandard
- toggle ts-standard on/off
- use system path or path var (no aggressive walking) || fallback to project
- remove as much settings as possible:
  - selectors
  - view path
  - log errors
  - adavanced crap
- remove project settings, leave that to package json and use it

## Maybes
